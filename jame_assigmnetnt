 #An Analysis of Data on Activity 
    
 **Reading data into R Studio**
    
```{r, echo=TRUE}
 stappes = read.table("activity.csv", header = T, sep =",")
 stappdf = data.frame(stappes)
 summary(stappdf)
```

**Total number of steps taken per day and naming the categorized   variables**
    
```{r, echo=TRUE}
stapp <- aggregate.data.frame(stappes$steps,
by = list(stappdf$date), FUN = sum)
names(stapp) <- c("date", "sumsteps")
print(stapp)
```

**Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day**
    
```{r, echo=TRUE}
 plot(stappes3$steps, type = "l", color = "magenta", xlab= "day", ylab=
       "sumsteps")
 ```
 *Calculate average  steps by day*
    
##Average daily activity pattern
    
stappes1 <- aggregate(stappdf$steps,
by =  list(stappdf$date), FUN = mean)
names(stappes1) <- c("date", "meansteps")
print(stappes1)
     
     
##Calculate median of the number of steps takeb per day 

stappes4 <- aggregate(stappdf$steps,
by =  list(stappdf$date), FUN = median)
names(stappes4) <- c("date", "median of steps per day")
print(stappes4)

##Plotting the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days

```{r qplot, fig.width=7, fig.height=7, ECHO=TRUE)}
library (ggplot2)
qplot(stappdf$interval, stappdf$steps,xlab = "mean interval per 
day", ylab="mean steps per day", color= "wheat",  type = "1",  main = "Five-minute interval by  steps",
geom  = c("point","smooth"), method ="lm")
```

*The interval that has the largest number of steps occurs on  2012-10-06* 
    
#Imputing missing values
    
*Calculating total number of missing values*
    
```{r, echo=TRUE}
 stappes_msvas=sapply(stapp, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
 stappes_msvas
  ```
Reported number of  mssing values is **2304** for steps variable 
#Filling in the missing values using the mean


```{r,echo=TRUE}
stappes$steps[is.na(stappes$steps)]
 mean(stappes$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
stappes$steps[is.na(stappes$steps)] <- mean(stappes$steps,             na.rm = TRUE)
stappes$steps
```

*Missing values for interval*
    
```{r, echo=TRUE}
stappes$interval[is.na(stappes$interval)]
median(stappes$interval, na.rm = TRUE)
stappes$interval[is.na(stappes$interval)]<- median(stappes$interval, na.rm = TRUE)
stappes$interval
```
 # data frame with MAs steps and interval variables filled

```{r, echo=TRUE}
stappes_ma_filled <- data.frame(stappes$steps, stappes$date,stappes$interval)
print(stappes_ma_filled
```

*Histogram of the steps taken by day with MA filled*
    
    
 ```{r qplot,fig.width=7, fig.height=5, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
hist.ggplot <- ggplot(stappes_ma_filled, aes(x = stappes.steps,color="wheat"))
g.his <- hist.ggplot +geom_histogram()
print(g.his)
```
*The mean and medium of total steps by day
**Mean of steps is 37.38; median is 0** [unchanged]

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(stappes_ma_filled) 
```

*The effect of filling in inmissing values with means seems toenhance smoothness of the   distribution*.

```{r, echo =TRUE}
stappdf = data.frame(stappes)
df = transform(stappdf, steps = ifelse(is.na(steps), mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE), steps))
df1 =transform(stappdf, interval = ifelse(is.na(interval),         
mean(interval, na.rm=TRUE), interval)) 
```
*Graphically*
```{r qplot,  fig.width=7, fig.height=5, echo=TRUE}
qplot(interval, stepp1, data = stappdf1, color= "orange",  type ="1",  main = " five-minute interval by  steps", geom  =                 c("point","smooth"),  method ="lm")
 ```
##Activity patterns on weekends and weekdays

 *Converting dates into weekends and weekdays*
    
```{r, ECHO=TRUE}
mydates <- as.Date(stappeplete$stappes.date)
mydadates1 <-weekdays(mydates)
```
*creating 'differentiators', the two levels and labels*
    
 ```{r, echo=TRUE}
 mydates2<- c("Monday",  "Tuesday",  "Wednesday",  "Thursday", "Friday")
 mydates3 <- factor((weekdays(mydates) %in% mydates2), 
levels=c(FALSE, TRUE),  labels  =  c("Weekend", "weekday"))
```
*Creation of dataframe with a new factor variable*
   
    
```{r, echo = TRUE}
stappeplete1<-data.frame(stappeplete, mydate4$date_by_day)
names(stappeplete1) <- c("steps", "date", "interval", "day_week")
```
*Making things abit neater* 
    
```{r, echo=TRUE}
stapt <- data.frame(stappeplete1)
 ```
*Creating subsets of weekend days and weekday days*
    
```{r, echo= TRUE}
(stapt2 <- stapt[stapt$day_week == "weekend", ])
(stapt3 <- stapt[stapt$day_week == "weekday", ])
```

# Plot intervals by weekends and weekdays

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, echo=TRUE}
par(mfrow = c (2,2))
plot(stapt2$interval, stapt2$steps,type="l", color = "blue", xlab      ="Interval",  ylab ="Steps on weekends")
plot(stapt3$interval, stapt3$steps, type="l",color="blue", xlab     = "Interval", ylab="Steps on weekdays")
```
##*Conclusion*
*There is apparently a marked difference in the pattern of activity on weekdays and weekends. On weekdays actvity is very intensive  
during early mmorning, peaks somewhat quickly and starts to fall  off, albeit with intermitent spurts along the way. For the weekends 
activity seems intense during later hours. It is also important to    note that the concentration of pockets of time of intense activity
seems to occur more in batches with respect to weekends than on   weekdays. Another important difference between the two categories 
lies in the high concentration of activity (more compact) compared   with somewhat slightly paced activity on weekends.
